# ROS-Bug-Algorithm
An implementation of a bug algorithm using ROS for COMP 417. Follows the M-Line towards the goal until it reaches a wall, at which point it follows the wall until it encounters the m-line again at a closer location to the goal and then repears the process.

The entirety of the workspace was uploaded as originally this repo was intended to help my classmates who struggled to get skeleton code for ROS up and running.
